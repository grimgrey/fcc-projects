        <h3>Here's a timeline of Ken Thompson's Life</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1943</strong> - Born in New Orleans, Louisiana</li>
          <li>
            <strong>1965</strong> - Reeceived Bachelor of Science in Electrical
            Engineering and Computer Science from University of California,
            Berkley
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1966</strong> - Received a Master's in Electrical
            Engineering and Computer Science from University of California,
            Berkley under the guidance of Elwyn Berlekamp. He was hired by Bell
            Labs in the same year.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1969</strong> - Developed the Unix operating system in
            collaboration with Dennis Ritchie and Rudd Canaday. In conjunction
            with the development of UNIX, Thompson, with some help from Ritchie,
            created the B programming which was a precursor to C.Thompson
            developed the standard text editor on 'Unix ed,' which, along with
            'QED,' which made regular expressions universal in 'Unix' text
            processing programs. He also invented Thompson's construction
            algorithm to convert the regular expression into a nondeterministic
            finite automaton, which made expression matching faster.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1973</strong> - Throughout the 1970s, Thompson and Ritchie
            majorly worked on the 'Unix' operating system. In 1973 Thompson and
            Ritchie rewrote Unix in C.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1975</strong> - Took a sabbatical from Bell Labs and went to
            his alma mater, UC Berkeley. There, he helped to install Version 6
            Unix on a PDP-11/70. Unix at Berkeley would later become maintained
            as its own system, known as the Berkeley Software Distribution
            (BSD).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1976</strong> - In early 1976, Thompson wrote the initial
            version of Berkeley Pascal at the Computer Science Division,
            Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, UC
            Berkeley (with extensive modifications and additions following later
            that year by William Joy, Charles Haley and faculty advisor Susan
            Graham.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1980</strong> - Belle, a computer chess program that
            Thompson had developed with Joseph H. Condon, another engineer at
            Bell Labs, won the World Computing Chess Championship.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1980</strong> - Thompson was elected to the U.S. National
            Academy of Sciences and the U.S. National Academy of Engineering.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1983</strong> - Thompson and Ritchie jointly received the
            Turing Award "for their development of generic operating systems
            theory and specifically for the implementation of the UNIX operating
            system". Thompson was also named a fellow by Bell Labs the same
            year.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1990</strong> - Both Thompson and Dennis Ritchie received
            the IEEE Richard W. Hamming Medal from the Institute of Electrical
            and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), "for the origination of the UNIX
            operating system and the C programming language".
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1992</strong> - Developed the UTF-8 encoding scheme together
            with Rob Pike.[20] UTF-8 encoding has since become the dominant
            character encoding for the World Wide Web, accounting for more than
            90% of all web pages in 2019.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1995</strong> - Assisted Dennis Ritchie in the design and
            implementation of the Plan 9 (1995) and Inferno(1996) operating
            systems at Bell Labs.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1997</strong> - In 1997, both Thompson and Ritchie were
            inducted as Fellows of the Computer History Museum for "the
            co-creation of the UNIX operating system, and for development of the
            C programming language"
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1999</strong> - On April 27, 1999, Thompson and Ritchie
            jointly received the 1998 National Medal of Technology from
            President Bill Clinton for co-inventing the UNIX operating system
            and the C programming language which together have "led to enormous
            advances in computer hardware, software, and networking systems and
            stimulated growth of an entire industry, thereby enhancing American
            leadership in the Information Age". In 1999, the Institute of
            Electrical and Electronics Engineers chose Thompson to receive the
            first Tsutomu Kanai Award "for his role in creating the UNIX
            operating system, which for decades has been a key platform for
            distributed systems work".
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2000</strong> - Retired from Bell Labs in December 2000. He
            worked at Entrisphere, Inc. as a fellow until 2006 and now works at
            Google as a Distinguished Engineer.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2009</strong> - Co-designed the Go Programming Language.
          </li>
